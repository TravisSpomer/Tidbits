# Getting started

Travis's Tidbits is a collection of TypeScript utilities with no dependencies, provided as ES Modules. You can install the [package from NPM](https://npmjs.com/@travisspomer/tidbits).

```console
npm install @travisspomer/tidbits
```

```console
yarn add @travisspomer/tidbits
```

Then, you use it the same way you use any other module. I dunno; I'm not an expert in this stuff.

```ts
import { toBoolean } from "@travisspomer/tidbits"
```

# Documentation

So what's in the package?

* [Conversions](convert.md): Conversion utilities.
* [Delay](delay.md): Utilities for delaying function calls.
* [Historical UI](historical-ui.md): A small utility that allows you to control one or more mutually-exclusive popup UIs using the history stack.
